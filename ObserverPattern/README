## Observer Pattern

To implement this pattern, we must have to create two interfaces, Observer and Subject. 
We also need to create the classes that is going to implements this interfaces. 
In this case, I created two classes, ProductObserver and ConcreteObserver. 
One important thing to mention here is that ConcreteObserver is an generic class, and we will know will as soon as the main class is going to be shown. 
So, as I said, the ProductObserver class is going to implement the Observer interface and the ConcreteObserver class is going to implement Subject interface. 
To increment the solution, I also created a simple class called Mail that contains a method called sendEmail, just to return a fake log that the email is going to be send.  
And to finish, the main class is going the ConcreteSubject class and the observers classes.
